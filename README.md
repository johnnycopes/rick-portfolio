# Rick Segal portfolio

### Live site: https://www.rick-segal.com/

A modern, minimalist portfolio I built for a friend who works as a Senior Producer at an advertisting agency. Built with Gatsby and Netlify CMS (with lots of help from their great documentation). This is actually the second version of the project; the first one was built with Angular (see old repo [here](https://github.com/johnnycopes/rick-portfolio-old)).

#### Goals of this project:

- Learn more about React and its ecosystem by building a real-world project with it
- Learn how to use a modern static site generator
- Configure a CMS so that my friend can manage his content without me

#### Local installation:

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm start`, which will kick Gatsby into gear and serve the site in a new tab with hot reloading.
1. If you'd like to clear the cache and restart the site, you can run `npm restart`
